This is a personal project for learning purposes. I do not expect this to be a finished project or distributed, rather iterated on as I learn new things.

The purpose of this project is to take student responses and parse them out into a list of used words.

This is to check the frequency of words within a response, then compare students frequent words if desired.

The desired outcome is to find common trends between student responses in a strictly quantifiable and objective manner.

The idea came from a family member, who is a teacher, who wanted to identify trends in student responses without looking through every single response and comparing them.
However, she wanted to identify phrases which seemed to be more of a subjective task, one maybe for machine learning. Nonetheless I was intrigued, so I started working on this project.

This project is helping me with OOP, algorithms, complex logic, and the fundamentals of python. This is also my first project I am uploading to GitHub, so it is a great help for learning that as well.
